# tokeninfo
Shows information on a list of Discord tokens like email, username, discriminator, profile picture, id, etc. as well as an easy way to copy the information.

Notes:
- Not mulithreaded (this can be easily implemented, I forgot why but I multithread any and all discord botting actions besides token verification)
- Will crash if you load a second token list as I never clear the original one (I think? I'm too lazy to check if I ever fixed it)
